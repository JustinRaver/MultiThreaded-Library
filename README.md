* Author: Justin Raver
* Class: CS121 Section #03
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This program creates a Java GUI for a simple Library. This 
library allows you to load a file from csv and view the correspoding 
books in the shape of BookButtons. Once the file is loaded you can 
select the books and view thier material in the Reader area. 

## Compiling and Running

 All project files should be in the same directory.
 
 From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the driver class:
    $ javac ReaderOfBooks.javac

Run the program
    $ java ReaderOfBooks
 
## Reflection (Project Development and Testing)

The ReaderOfBooks project has been an excellent test of patience and problem solving. 
I consistently struggled with this project. My first large stumble was with the 
BookButtonListener and how to pass the listener to from a toplevel class to a sub class 
LibraryPanel. I was able to resolve the Action listener by passing in through the
constructor of LibraryPanel and creating an instance of ActionListener set equal to 
the listener passed through the library panel constructor. I also struggled with the 
alignment of the BookButtons,the JLabels, and other components within the Panels. 
Through reading the Java api I was able to resolve my style issues. 

The adjustment listener was interesting because it used so many unique methods to 
achieve its desired results. I used a notebook to write out the logic of the listener
and then uses print statements to test the output of the different methods. Once I had 
that information I was able to easily implement the methods and get the correct page 
numbers. I also added my enable disable if else staments for the page up and down logic
in the scrollBarListener so that it was automatically updated. 

I tested the project consistently both with the front end and back end aspects. I realized 
quickly that building from the largest components to the smallest made the GUI the easiest 
for me because I could test the implementation immediately. I used both the BookTesterUnit 
and LibraryTesterUnit to test my library and new csv method. I used print statements to test 
the output of methods and then implement them. 

Interfaces helped to Implement the new methods.
